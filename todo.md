# Quantum-Aware AI Context Oracle for Web3 Agents - Project Checklist

## 1. Define the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- [x] Create JSON schema for context objects
- [x] Define fields for model information (ID, type, capabilities)
- [x] Define fields for context details (task goal, environment state, permissions)
- [x] Define fields for provenance trail and output structure
- [x] Validate the schema using JSON Schema validators

## 2. Build a Basic MCP Gateway
- [x] Set up project structure for the gateway
- [x] Create a web server using Node.js Express
- [x] Implement endpoint for receiving MCP messages
- [x] Add logging functionality for received messages
- [x] Implement simple acknowledgment response

## 3. Connect Gateway to a Simulated Quantum Backend
- [x] Create a simulated quantum random number generator function
- [x] Implement API endpoint in the gateway to access the QRNG
- [x] Add functionality to process random number requests
- [x] Test the data flow between gateway and simulated quantum backend

## 4. Integrate a Basic AI Agent
- [x] Create a simple AI agent structure
- [x] Implement functionality to receive and parse MCP messages
- [x] Add capability to interpret the "goal" from messages
- [x] Implement communication with the gateway for random numbers
- [x] Add functionality to update MCP messages with results
- [x] Update the provenance trail in MCP messages

## 5. Implement Web3 Integration with a Simple Smart Contract
- [x] Set up a development blockchain environment
- [x] Write a basic smart contract in Solidity
- [x] Implement storage functionality for session IDs and outputs
- [x] Create connection between off-chain system and blockchain
- [x] Implement transaction sending from MCP Gateway/AI Agent

## 6. Develop the Frontend dApp for Basic Interaction
- [x] Set up project structure for the frontend
- [x] Create basic UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- [x] Implement "Get Quantum Random Number" button and results display
- [x] Connect frontend to MCP Gateway API endpoints
- [x] Test the complete user interaction flow

## 7. Integrate Decentralized Storage for Detailed Context Logs
- [x] Set up connection to decentralized storage (IPFS or Ceramic)
- [x] Implement storage of full MCP context objects
- [x] Create hash generation for stored objects
- [x] Implement blockchain recording of hashes
- [x] Create linking between on-chain records and off-chain logs
